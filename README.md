  Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Kamadulski
  
 &emsp; I am an Analytical Chemist who is learning to code. I find the design, analysis, and troubleshooting skills I have developed in my career as a scientist translate well to coding. I enjoy the logical structure behind the code and savor those Eureka moments when everything finally comes together. Recently, I graduated from a full stack JavaScript bootcamp at Washington University in St Louis. Currently, I am continuing to study JavaScript while pursuing my first job as a web developer. </br></br>
 &emsp; If you have any questions, comments, or concerns please contact me. I would love to connect with you to hear about any new opportunities or just to chat about coding.
