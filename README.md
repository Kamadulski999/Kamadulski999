  Hi, Iâ€™m Andrew Kamadulski
  
  I am an Analytical Chemist who is learning to code. I find the analysis and troubleshooting skills I have developed in my career as a scientist translate well to coding. 
  I enjoy the logical structure behind the code and savor those Eureka moments when everything finally comes together. Currently I'm studying Full Stack Web Development in a coding bootcamp at Washington University. In the future, I hope to continue to learn more programming languages and techniques that will allow me to grow as a programmer and scientist.

  When I'm not coding I enjoy spending time hiking and camping with my wife and 3 dogs, keeping several freshwater aquariums, and fossil hunting.
